TL;DR Ed would be fine either way. Putting the Blueprint on the Baron would be less, but still enough. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7371575d-47e6-4367-83b9-d7ca7770d57b)


Now for the exact measurements. I have created scenarios that could occur if Ed were to be a little less fortunate. (The boss was 1,200,000 chips)

| Scenerio | Chips scored | Total chips |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Blueprint on Hanging Chad (what Ed played) | 2,332,998 | 2,466,908 |
| Blueprint on Hanging Chad, but only 1 king (2 would be enough) | 1,044,288 | 1,178,198 |
| Blueprint on hanging chad, but no glass | 200,406 | 334,316 |
| Blueprint on baron (good to know I wouldn't have been banned ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d3fc710-d9ad-4f78-8e3a-d780148b7c1d) ) | 1,961,577 | 2,095,487 |
| Blueprint on baron, but no glass | 457,881 | 591,791 |
| Old setup with Gluttenous Joker (no Baron nor Campfire) | 413,586 | 547,496 |
| If Ed didn't opt in for Campfire | 1,166,499 | 1,300,409 |

Believe it or not. The blueprint on the Hanging Chad can be improved with one simple swap. The net profit is 0 chips, but you get to kill the final boss with an AK-47 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9492eb55-59b7-4e12-bacd-31beb645e5f2)

Thank you, Ed, for fun stream. The last round got really stressful for a moment

P.S. The script for calculating the scenarios is available in the same repository. Like any code, it is prone to bugs, and some scenarios might be incorrect. Also, it only calculates based on the last hand, so while the old setup scored 457,881 it's possible that Ed could have played multiple hands as good as this one.
